This repo contains all the solutions of exercise and code snippets that has been included within: AI and Machine Learning for Coders by Laurence Moroney. 

I take great pleasure in engaging with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning resources. My introduction to the technical aspects of AI/ML occurred while pursuing my studies at university, which placed a strong emphasis on Mathematics. Recently, I acquired a book that provides an coder's perspective on AI/ML. I commenced reading this book on June 21, 2023, and I am eagerly anticipating its completion.
